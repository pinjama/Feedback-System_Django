# Feedback System - Django

Project done as a team effort.
Feedback System is in finnish.

**Feedback system**
A simple feedback system, where the user can do registration and log in. User first chooses which course to give feedback on. The user is asked for a rating on a scale of 1-5, what was good, bad and what could be improved. The date and time of feedback are created automatically. The following are stored in the database: date and time, grade (integer 1-5), good (text), bad (text) and ideas (text) and, of course, what topic the feedback was related to, and the person giving the feedback.

App includes a web-based maintenance user interface protected with a username and password, with which the administrator can view the results by topic. All the results can be combined to excel file. System allows the administrator to add new topics where to give feedback. This way the system could be used to give feedback on different courses.

Here is a short video about the app!
